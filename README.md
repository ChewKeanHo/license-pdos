A published research and experimentation friendly open-source license
originally for [(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) but
is now open to all product licensing purposes. Initially, this license was
design for public domain deployment but after multiple improvement iterations.
However, under the author(s) strong opinions, the license had converged into
[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Research and Libre License](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13777226).
This is due to none of the author want to forgo some important clauses
matching existing public domain licenses due to their important responsibilties.
Hence, starting from version `v4.0.0`, this license shall be superseded by its
convergence. To avoid misleading You, You are advised and shall to use any of
the following licenses instead:

1. [(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Research and Libre License](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13777226)
2. [Public Domain Mark](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/pdm/)

and

as its baseline and applied the following changes:

   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
   design, audio, etc) without needing to spin multiple outbound licenses; AND

   and how is the license applied; AND
3. Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
   default; AND
4. Added artifical intelligence training dataset usage clauses; AND
5. Added Sensitive Data warranty and liability coverage; AND
